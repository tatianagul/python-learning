### Note About Cart Logic

In this project, the cart stores references to Product objects.

If the same product is added multiple times, it is stored multiple times in the cart as references to the same object.
Product stock (amount) represents warehouse quantity and is decreased when a product is added to the cart.

This behavior is intentional and accepted as a simplified model for a learning project.
