My Python learning projects (OOP, small exercises, practice).

## 🧩 Projects

### 1. Bank Account (OOP)
📂 `location: oop/bank_account.py`

A simple object-oriented project that simulates a bank account.

**Concepts used:**
- classes and objects
- `__init__` constructor
- instance methods
- `@staticmethod`
- lists for storing data
- basic validation logic

---

### 2. Online Store (Console App, OOP)
📂 `location: online_store/`

A console-based online store simulation where users can browse products,
search by name, add items to a cart, and manage their cart.

**Concepts used:**
- object-oriented programming (OOP)
- base classes and subclasses
- composition (store, cart, products)
- search functionality
- user input handling
- console menu navigation

---

### 3. Command Engine (Console Commands)
📂 `location: oop/command_engine/`

A console-based command engine built to practice command routing and project structure.
This project was created as preparation for building Telegram bots in the future.

**Concepts used:**
- command registry
- decorators
- command routing
- dictionary-based architecture
- error handling
- user input parsing

---

### 4. Expense Tracker (Console Application)
📂 `location: oop/expense-tracker/`

A console-based expense tracker built while learning file handling and basic application architecture in Python.

This project focuses on working with persistent data and structuring a small but complete console application.

**Concepts used:**
- JSON data storage
- file handling and error handling
- CSV export
- ZIP backups
- pathlib
- modular project structure
- interactive console menu

---

### 5. Text Analyzer (Regex Project)
📂 `location: regex/text-analyzer/`

A console-based text analyzer built to practice working with regular expressions and text processing in Python.

This project focuses on extracting structured data from raw text and organizing the logic in a clean, modular way.

**Concepts used:**
- regular expressions (`re`)
- file reading with `pathlib`
- data extraction and normalization
- validation logic
- modular project structure

## 📌 Notes
This is a learning repository. Code may be refactored and improved as I continue studying Python.
